# Technology Risk & Controls

## Overview
This repository documents practical approaches to identifying, assessing, and managing technology risk within enterprise IT environments. The focus is on control objectives, governance, and decision-making rather than tool-specific implementations.

Technology risk exists across systems, applications, identities, and operational processes. This project examines how organizations structure risk assessments and align controls to support reliability, audit readiness, and business objectives.

---

## Objectives
The goals of this repository are to:
- Document common technology risk categories in enterprise IT environments
- Describe control objectives used to mitigate identified risks
- Explore how risk and controls align with governance and compliance requirements
- Provide clear, repeatable documentation suitable for non-technical stakeholders

---

## Scope
In scope:
- Enterprise IT systems and supporting infrastructure
- Identity, access, and privilege-related risks
- Operational and configuration risks
- Governance, policy, and control alignment

Out of scope:
- Penetration testing
- Exploit development
- Tool-specific hardening guides
- Red team or SOC-focused activities

---

## Technology Risk Categories
This section outlines common technology risk areas encountered in enterprise environments, including:
- Access and identity risk
- Configuration and change management risk
- Availability and resilience risk
- Logging, monitoring, and visibility gaps
- Third-party and dependency risk

Each category is evaluated in terms of likelihood, impact, and business consequence.

---

## Control Objectives
Rather than prescribing specific tools, this repository focuses on control objectives such as:
- Least privilege and access governance
- Configuration baselines and change controls
- Monitoring and auditability
- Incident detection and response readiness
- Documentation and accountability

---

## Governance and Reporting
Effective risk management depends on clear governance structures and communication. This section explores:
- Risk ownership and accountability
- Documentation and reporting practices
- Alignment with internal policies and external frameworks
- Metrics used to track control effectiveness

---

## Key Artifacts

- Sample Technology Risk Register: [View Document](https://github.com/adombrowiak/technology-risk-and-controls/blob/main/technology-risk-register.md)

---

## Future Enhancements
Planned additions may include:
- Risk-to-control mapping artifacts
- Example governance documentation
- Metrics and reporting templates

---

## Notes
This repository is intended to reflect real-world enterprise risk management practices. The emphasis is on clarity, structure, and decision-making rather than technical depth for its own sake.
