# Technology Risk Register

## Purpose
This document provides a sample technology risk register illustrating how enterprise organizations identify, assess, and track technology-related risks. The focus is on clarity, repeatability, and alignment with governance and control objectives rather than exhaustive technical detail.

---

## Risk Assessment Approach
Risks are evaluated using a qualitative approach based on:
- Likelihood of occurrence
- Potential business impact
- Existing controls and mitigations
- Residual risk after controls are applied

Risk ownership and accountability are emphasized to support governance and decision-making.
